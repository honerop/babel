# Filesystem, paths and subprocesses in Babel

Babel provides compact native operations for common filesystem and process tasks,
with explicit effects and recoverable errors.

```text
folder = pathjoin "reports" "2026"
print asbool field fsmkdir folder "ok"
files = fslist folder
print encode field files "value"
reply = processrun "printf" push array _ boxstr "Hello Babel"
print astext field field reply "value" "stdout"
```

## Filesystem operations

- `fslist PATH`: sorted list of entry filenames, as a recoverable Data result.
- `fsmkdir PATH`: recursively create a directory, return a Data result.
- `fsremove PATH`: delete one regular file, not recursively delete folders.
- `pathjoin LEFT RIGHT`: join native filesystem paths without I/O.
- `workingdir _`: current directory as a recoverable Data result.

`fslist` limits output to 10,000 entries and requires UTF-8 names.
`fslist` checks the optional `read` capability, while creation/removal
checks `write` when `BABEL_RESTRICTED=1`.

## Subprocess execution

`processrun PROGRAM ARGS` accepts a Data list of text arguments. It starts
a subprocess **without invoking a shell**. The return value is a recoverable
Data record with `ok`, `value`, `error`; `value` contains `code`,
`stdout`, and `stderr`.

The process has a 10-second timeout by default. For long-running jobs such as
video encoding, set `BABEL_PROCESS_TIMEOUT_MS` to a positive timeout in
milliseconds (maximum 1,800,000, or 30 minutes). Invalid values fall back to
10 seconds. The builtin accepts at most 128 arguments and limits
stdout/stderr to 1 MiB each. Binary output is rejected as a recoverable
error. A nonzero exit status is returned under `value.code`, not treated as a
transport failure.

The implementation checks `process` capability when restricted, but
**this is not a sandbox**: spawned processes run with the actual operating
system permissions and can have side effects independent of Babel's builtin
permission checks. For untrusted generated programs, use OS isolation.

The legacy `run PROGRAM ONE_ARG` convenience builtin remains available,
but the new `processrun` supports argument arrays, captured output and
recoverable error handling.

The native Rust backend implements these operations; the bootstrap C and
experimental AIR/LLVM subsets have not been upgraded. Generated-program
regression tests exercise real files, directories, processes and type errors.

## Foreground terminal commands (experimental)

- `termwrite TEXT` prints without adding a newline and flushes stdout, useful for prompts.
- `changedir PATH` changes the current Babel process directory, returning a recoverable Data result.
- `processinherit PROGRAM ARGS` launches an executable with stdin, stdout and stderr attached to the calling terminal. `ARGS` is a Data list of strings. The return record contains `ok`, `value.code`, and `error`. Unlike `processrun`, this is not an output-capture API.

These operations are designed for Babel-native shells such as Plica. The child uses the same terminal foreground process group. Proper separate process groups, signal handling and job control are not yet implemented. This is not yet a complete POSIX shell execution environment.

Both operations touching the filesystem or spawning programs respect Babel's optional builtin permission flags, which are *not* an operating-system sandbox.
